# Are scikit-learn's K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm and Redis's KNN search the same? Is there any correlation?

## Answer

Yes — the *name* “K-Nearest Neighbours” shows up in both places, but the role it plays in **scikit-learn’s KNN algorithm** and **Redis’s KNN search** is quite different, even though they are conceptually related.

## 1. K-Nearest Neighbours in scikit-learn (Algorithm)
- **Type:** A *supervised machine learning algorithm*.
- **Purpose:** Given a labelled training dataset, predict the label of a new input by finding the *k* training examples most similar (nearest) to it and doing a “vote” or “average” over their labels.
- **Key steps:**
  1. Store all training data points and their labels.
  2. For a new query point, compute the distance to all training points (e.g., Euclidean).
  3. Pick the `k` closest ones.
  4. For classification → majority label wins; for regression → take average of labels.

**Example:**  
You have fruit images labelled as “apple” or “orange”. A new image comes in → KNN finds the `k` closest images in the training set and assigns the majority label.

## 2. K-Nearest Neighbour Search in Redis (Vector Search)
- **Type:** A *search/retrieval operation*, not a full supervised learning algorithm.
- **Purpose:** From a set of stored vectors (embeddings), retrieve the *k* vectors most similar to a given query vector.
- **Key steps:**
  1. You’ve already stored embeddings (numeric vector representations) of items in Redis’s vector index.
  2. You provide a query vector.
  3. Redis finds the `k` closest vectors using a similarity metric (cosine similarity, dot product, or Euclidean distance).
  4. It returns the items and their similarity scores.

**Example:**  
You store 10,000 document embeddings in Redis. A new query (“AI in healthcare”) is converted to a vector → Redis KNN search finds the top-5 most similar document vectors.

## 3. How They’re Related
- **Commonality:**
  - Both are based on the *same mathematical idea*: “find the `k` closest items to a given query point according to a distance or similarity metric.”
- **Differences:**
  - **In scikit-learn** → KNN is a *learning method* that uses nearest neighbours to make predictions.
  - **In Redis** → KNN is a *search operation* that retrieves similar items. It doesn’t predict labels — it’s just finding nearest neighbours in a vector space.
- **Overlap:**
  - If you *had* labelled data stored in Redis, you could in theory implement scikit-learn–style KNN prediction by performing a Redis KNN search and then majority-voting the labels.
  - In most GenAI or vector DB contexts, the KNN search step is used for retrieval in pipelines like **RAG**, not for classical ML classification.

**In short:**
> scikit-learn’s KNN = *algorithm for classification/regression* (supervised learning).  
> Redis’s KNN search = *operation for similarity-based retrieval* (unsupervised, no labels).  
They share the same distance-based neighbour-finding concept, but are used in different contexts and for different purposes.
